## Rules:

* Every hour:

  * 10 pushups, 10 squats, 10 kicks, 10 punches
  * Surprises at 75-minutes in

## What we're going to build and perform
* Full stack ML application --let's build
  * Collect Dataset
  * Model dataset
  * Build application
  * Deploy application
    * Gradio
    * Live Web app(TensorFlow.js)
    * API?

### Collect Dataset

* Need images of food and not food
    * For images of Not Food: Download random images from imageNet
    * For images of Food: random subset of images from Food101

* ML model motto: "If I had 8 hours to build learning model, I'd spend the first 6 hours preparing my dataset."

### Model Dataset

* Build a computer vision model to classify food and no food

### Build Application

* Simple HTML with JavaScript

### Deploy model

* We've got a few options here:
    * Gradio
    * TensorFlow.Js
    * API?
